GEMDeCan: Gene Expression and Methylation based Deconvolution for Cancer

## Welcome to the GEMDeCan repository.  
You will find here two snakemake pipelines to process and perform deconvolution on gene expression and methylation data, in the respectively named folders.  
Each pipeline comes with a readme detailing its installation and usage.

## Data availability
The code to reproduce all figures is available in this repository under `Paper_Figure_code.Rmd`.  
All data to reproduce those figures are freely available on Figshare :
